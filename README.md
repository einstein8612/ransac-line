# ransac-line

This is a repository containing the code for fast line fitting, meant to be used by my [VLP](https://github.com/einstein8612/VLP) project. As such it's highly optimised for this specific case and will not change, unless it improves performance for that case. The API might be a bit weird as a consequence.

# Tests
```bash
$ ./test_all.sh --clean
```
